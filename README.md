## Abstract

Given the increase in administrative and legal repression of civil
society, how have their donors responded? How do these responses differ
across foreign government and private donors? How have local
philanthropists and NGOs adapted and responded to such repression? What
challenges do civil society groups continue to face despite these
responses?

## 🍬🦇: Note on “butterscotch bat” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to
generate an [Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14).

codename(seed = "handbook donors", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "butterscotch bat"
```
