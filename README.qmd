## `r emoji_glue(":person_feeding_baby::bat:")`: Note on "butterscotch bat
Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting, and peer review, we used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to generate an [Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames) internal-to-us project name that wonâ€™t change.

```{r generate-code-name, eval=FALSE}
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14).

codename(seed = "handbook donors", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "butterscotch bat"
```
